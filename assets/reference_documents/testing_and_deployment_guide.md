# Testing and Deployment

Testing this website includes both the basic functionality and the creative ability. How the website looks and the emotions it creates for the visitor are as important as whether a pop-up or link works correctly. If any features of the website are slow or hesitant to load or the font is too small or not legible, it will spoil the experience .Any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors will reduce the professionalism of the site and may hinder the any future career prospects.
##### Load the Web Page
Open an internet browser and use this link [Portfolio](https://siobhanbaines.github.io/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/) to open the website. 

## Global Testing
The chosen font and colour scheme are global to the website but will need checking for unexpected behaviour on all the pages on desktops, tablets and mobile devices. When testing this site, the Appearance Testing needs to be validated on all pages and between desktop, tablet and mobile devices for consistency and to confirm it adheres to the design principles.
#### Appearance Testing
##### Font Style
The font style needs to be easy to read, clean and professional in appearance. 
Mulish is crisp, clean, professional and a little bit different to the normal Helvetica or Calibri. 
##### Font Colour
The font colour needs to contrast with its background, if it too similar to the colour behind it, the font will not be legible. The image and header and footer are a light colour determining the font colour needs to be dark to stand out.
Black can be too stark against the light background. The font chosen is a dark blue (#444c5d) taken from the colour palette created by using the image on the index.html page
##### Font Size
The font size needs to be large enough to be legible and to improve the appearance of the page. 
Different font sizes are used through-out the website which gives emphasis where it is needed and
the ability to add more information.
Changing the font size is used to change the size of the social media icons. 
The font size in the body needs to be large enough to grab the visitor’s attention and give a clear indication about my career
##### Font Position
The fonts horizontal position on the header and footer needs to be in the centre to help give balance to the page
##### Header
The choice of colour for the header should complement the image on the index.html. This can be achieved by using a colour palette (#c4d4df) created from the image on the index.html.  The header bar must file the full with of the viewport and it must be fixed to the bottom of the screen.
The menu options must be to the left of the header bar and be positioned centrally on the vertical axis. This gives a clean sense of symmetry. 
##### Footer
The choice of colour for the footer should complement the image on the index.html. This can be achieved by using a colour palette (#c4d4df) created from the image on the index.html. I chose the same colour for both header and footer because I believe it gives balance to the site.  The footer bar must file the full with of the viewport and it must be fixed to the bottom of the screen.
The icons must be position centrally both horizontally and vertically to give symmetry to the footer.
##### Background
The background must cover the whole of the viewport with no gaps at the edges. 
There should be no scroll bars either vertical or horizontal.
##### Call to action
A call to action needs to complement the style of the site and encourage the visitor to interact with the website. In this case the visitor is encouraged to download my curriculum vitae which gives full information about my past career, what I have achieved and what I can bring to a new position.

### Desktop Testing
#### Navigation Testing
The purpose of the Navigation menu is to enable the site visitor to move around the site easily. Testing the Navigation involves checking 
•	each option works as detailed below taking the visitor to the relevant pages
•	that the menu has a good sense of balance and symmetry 
•	that the options an easily read and clear to the visitor.
##### Home 
The Home menu option should always bring the visitor back to the Home page. When the user is on the Home page, it should appear that nothing has happened. The Home menu option should be a little bolder than the other options to show the visitor where to go back to in case of any confusion.
##### My Story
The My Story menu option should always bring the visitor back to the My Story page. When the user is on the My Story page, it should appear that nothing has happened.
##### Projects
The Projects menu option should always bring the visitor back to the Projects page. When the user is on the Projects page, it should appear that nothing has happened
##### Contact
The Contact menu option should always bring the visitor back to the Contact page. When the user is on the Contact page, it should appear that nothing has happened
##### CV Download
The CV Download menu option should open the curriculum vitae on a separate  tab and the document should be in pdf format.

#### Social Media Testing
The purpose of the Social Media menu is to allow the visitor the ability to find out more about me, what I have done, my social interactions and some of my hobbies and interests. Each icon used is standard icon for the linked social media site. 
##### Github
The Github icon should open the Github account of Siobhán Baines on a separate tab giving access to the projects Siobhán has created in Github. 
##### LinkedIn
The LinkedIn icon should open the LinkedIn account of Siobhán Baines in a separate tab.
##### Facebook
The Facebook icon should open the Facebook account of Siobhán Baines in a separate tab.

## Tablet Testing
##### Load the Web Page
Open an internet browser and use this link [Portfolio](https://siobhanbaines.github.io/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/) to open the website. 
When testing the website on a tablet it should behave the same as the website with the exception of 
1.	The My Story page may display the Qualifications timeline after the Work History timeline dependant of the viewport of the tablet.
2.	The Projects page may display the projects in three rows of two projects.

## Mobile Testing
##### Load the Web Page
Open an internet browser and use this link [Portfolio](https://siobhanbaines.github.io/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/) to open the website. 
When testing the website on a mobile device the features should behave the same as the website but the screens will look different.
#### Home Page 	- index.html
The alignment of the name and job title may be different.
The job title should still be offset to the right but part of it may appear on the line below.
### My Story Page	- my-story.html
If a visitor clicks on the phone number it should open up the phone app with the phone number already loaded ready for the visitor to press the call button.
The Qualifications timeline will appear after the Work History timeline dependant of the viewport of the tablet.
### Projects Page	- projects.html
Each project will appear one after the other by scrolling down the screen. Since there is no hover on a mobile, to view the description a visitor will need to ‘click-on’ the ‘i’.
### Contact Page 	- contact.html
The contact page will be narrower on the mobile device but should behave in the same way as on a desktop device.
## Performance Testing using Lighthouse
To test using lighthouse, right click the mouse on the home page (index.html) to open the DevTools pane and then look for the ‘>>’ at the top of the screen, select the arrows and Lighthouse will be at the bottom of the list. Select Lighthouse
On the next screen, scroll down to select either ‘Mobil’ or ‘Desktop’ and then scroll back up the screen to select ‘Generate Report’.
A screen looking like this will appear

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/index_tests/index-desktop-before.PNG)

If one of the circles is not green, select it to be taken to that area of the report.
The issues that need to be investigated have a red triangle at the beginning of the line. By using the dropdown arrow on the right of the error details of the error will appear as below.

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/dropdown_error.PNG)

If it is not clear what is wrong from the error select the ‘Learn more’ hyperlink to get more information.
Clicking on the element in error will open up the main DevTools at the place where the element is used and the css it is using. This information should help you to fix the issue.
Once you believe the issue is fixed and you have saved your changes in GitPod, refresh the webpage. To re-run the Lighthouse diagnostic report, you will need to close DevTools and reopen.

## Deployment
In Gitpod the bottom area of the screen is where git commands are entered.

![image]( https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/reference_documents/images_readme/image_gitpod.PNG)

1.	If you have been running the 8000 port you will need to use Ctrl + Z to escape back and use the command entry. This line will appear “gitpod /workspace/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio $” allowing commands to be entered.
2.	Make sure any changes that have been made are save by selecting the ‘File’ tab and ‘Save All’
3.	Type “git add .” to add all the changes ready to be committed. Remember the full stop because this will add everything that has been save. If only one file has been changed that file name can be entered instead of the full stop
4.	Type “git commit -m” immediately followed by a description of the change(s) being committed to Github 
5.	Type “git push” which will push everything to Github
6.	Open Github and the repository the website is in. To the far right of the menu bar is the Settings tab. Select this and scroll down to “GitHub Pages”
7.	Under Source if the dropdown menu has “None” select the “master” branch which will bring up the “(root)” folder, and click “Save”
8.	Your page will now show as published under the GitHub Pages section
