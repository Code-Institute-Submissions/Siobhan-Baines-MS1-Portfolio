This project is to build a static front-end which demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies. The subject of this project is my personal portfolio including information about my past, present and future career. The front-end is designed to give any user an informative, interesting, user friendly and professional experience. There will be navigation to 2/3 pages, links to my social media accounts, information about past projects and place holders for future projects, the ability to open my curriculum vitae on a separate tab in pdf format and the facility to contact me directly.

## User Experience (UX)



### *User Stories*

1. **An new visitor to the site**

   As a new visitor to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about, I want to be able to easily navigate around the site to find all it's content and I may want to be to check out their social media for any other useful information.

2. **A recruiter**

   As a recruiter I want this site to clearly showcase her ability and the technologies she is adept in using so that I can compare her skill set to those of my client.

3. **An employer**

   As an employer I want her site to show me some of her personality as well as her technologically skill set so that I can evaluate her fit with my team.

### *Strategy*
My design objective was to make the information on my site completely accessible and keep the pages as uncluttered as possible while giving all the information a visitor to my site might want or need.

### *Scope*
At the same time as providing a good outline of my skills and experience for a prospective employer I wanted to make the experience of using the site as enjoyable as possible and give them the facilities to download my curriculum vitae and/or contract me directly. 

### *Structure*
The about section will give a brief overview of who I am and what I have done throughout my career.
The projects section will highlight some of the larger projects I have previously worked on in IT and some place holders to the future mile stone projects with Code Institute which will have links (in time) to each of them.
There will be a contact page to allow prospective employers to contact me via email.
Finally, there will be links to my social media accounts including LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter and Instagram as well as providing the ability to download my CV which will open in a separate tab.

### *Skeleton*
[Wireframes](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/4b32379f0e76701ccb944197136907a9fdf6c8db/assets/reference%20documents/wireframes)

After working on various parts of the website I decided there were some things I did not like such as the icons for each menu option on the navigation bar, the positioning of the social media links, the download CV link and the layout of the My Story page (aka about).

### *Surface*
The colour scheme was taken from the colours of [index-image.jpg](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/4b32379f0e76701ccb944197136907a9fdf6c8db/assets/images/index-image.jpg) I believe the muted blues and browns give the site a more professional image. I chose the laptop and coffee image because I always have a coffee by my side when I am developing.
