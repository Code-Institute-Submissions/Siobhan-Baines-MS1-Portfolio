This project is to build a static front-end which demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies. 
The subject of this project is my personal portfolio including information about my past, present and future career. The front-end is designed to give any user an informative, interesting, user friendly and professional experience. There will be navigation to 3 pages, the first giving an outline of my previous career and skills, the second for details about some large past projects and placeholders for known future projects and the third giving a mechanism to contact me. There will also be links to my social media accounts and the ability to open my curriculum vitae on separate tab in pdf format.

## User Experience (UX)


### *User Stories*

1. **A new visitor to the site**

   As a new visitor to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about. I want to be able to easily navigate around the site to find all the information that is available including be able to download a copy of the curriculum vitae and the facility to check out their social media for any other useful information.

2. **A recruiter**

   As a recruiter I want this site to clearly showcase her career and educational history. I want to easily check her skill set comparing it against those required by my client. The ability to download her curriculum vitae will help to speed up the recruitment process and allow me to share her details with my client. I will need to have a quick and easy way to contact her if she meets the required criteria.
   
3. **An employer**

   As an employer I want her site to show me some of her personality as well as her technologically and soft skill sets so that I can evaluate her fit with my team and the job. I will want to contact her if she fits the profile I have in mind.

### *Strategy*
My design objective was to create a website showcasing a high-level of my technical skill set. I wanted the information to be easily accessible, clear and concise but at the same time giving the visitor everything they might want or need. 

### *Scope*
At the same time as providing a good outline of my skills and experience for a prospective employer I want to make the experience of using the site as enjoyable as possible and give them the facility to download my curriculum vitae and/or contract me directly as well as the ability to check out all my social media presence. I want some of my personality and style to come across in the site. 

### *Structure*
My landing page will be very simple with only my name and job title in the centre, a header navigation bar with the facility to download my CV and social media links on a static footer.

The 'My Story' page will give a brief overview of who I am and what I have done throughout my career in IT as well as the qualifications I have earned since leaving school.

The 'Projects' page will highlight some of the larger projects I have previously worked on my IT career and some place holders will be provided for the future mile stone projects with Code Institute which will have links to the projects source and deployed site.

### *Skeleton*
#### Wireframes
###### Initial Design
[Desktop](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/reference_documents/wireframes/initial_design/desktop_wire_frames_v1.0%20.pdf)

[Mobile](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/reference_documents/wireframes/initial_design/mobile_wire_frames_v1.0%20.pdf)

After working on various parts of the website I decided there were some things I did not like such as the icons for each menu option on the navigation bar, the positioning of the social media links, the download CV link and the layout of the My Story page (aka about).

###### Final Design
[Desktop](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/reference_documents/wireframes/final_design/desktop_wire_frames_v2.0.pdf)

### *Surface*
The colour scheme was taken from the colours of [index_image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/images/index_image.png), 
[colour pallet](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/reference_documents/colour_pallet.pdf)
I believe the muted blues and browns give the site a more professional image which is easy on the eye. I chose the laptop and coffee image because the concept seems to fit well with my working personality. I always have a coffee by my side when I am coding.

## Features

### Existing Features

##### Header navigation bar
The navigation bar items are positioned to the left side of the screen and aligned in the centre of the bar. They give access to the My Story, Projects and Contact pages as well as allowing the site visitor to download my Curriculum Vitae. The 'CV Download' link has a white border designed to draw the attention of the visitor to download my CV to get more information about me.

When the visitor is using a small or mobile device the navigation menu shows as the 'hamburger' icon and when selected expands to a dropdown menu. 

##### Footer
The final design of the footer is to have links to all my social media presence only. This feature will allow the visitor to gain more information about my technical abilities, the projects I have developed or worked on and an insight into who me as a person. 

##### Images
The images give the site a warm comfortable and professional feel.

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/contact_image.png)

##### Home Page
I wanted to keep the landing page eye catching but very simple which is why it only has my name and a future job title. 

##### My Story Page
Initially I thought I just wanted two or three sentences about me, what I have done and what I want to do but nothing I thought of seem appropriate or to add value. While looking on LinkedIn at some of my contact's pages, I noticed Lucy Jones had a link to her MS1 project which is her portfolio. Her website gave me the inspiration I need to create my own 'My Story' page. Her design showed me how I could have a small section about me and how to contact me, as well have two separate timelines, one for my work experience and one for qualifications.

##### Projects Page
In my orginial design I was only going to have the projects I will be completing through the course but this didn't feel right as I came to work on the page. I have over 30 years in Information Technology and have worked on many projects at various levels. It is appropriate this page included the at least the three most recent big projects I have been involved in as well as the milestone projects from the Diploma in Software Development course I am currently studying. As my career moves forward, I can expand this area to accommodate more projects. 

##### Contact Page
My contact page is very simple so I decided to use a background image to add interest. There are input fields for a name, email address and a decription of what the contact is in relation to.

### Features Left to Implement

Link to Milestone Project 2 - The interactive front-end project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

Link to Milestone Project 3  - The data centric project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

Link to Milestone Project 4 - The final project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

## Technologies Used
CSS3, HMTL5, Bootstrap Framework, Google, Fontawesome

## Testing
The testing process was on-going through-out the whole of the website development. I would change a colour and test it to see how it worked with my design. Adjusting the position of elements would involve multiple tests until it was in just the right place. I added padding and removed padding, added margins and removed margins just to see what result I would get. When the site was as good as I thought I could make it, I asked my family and friends to review it and later I asked for a peer-review on Slack.

### Test the Navigation Bar between Desktop and Mobile
Test the navigation bar collapses to give the 'hamburger' icon when the device is smaller than medium.
###### Development 
Initially I started out copying the source from [Whiskey Drop](https://siobhanbaines.github.io/BootstrapWhiskey/) but soon found there were items I did not understand so went back to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) and googled other navigation bars. My CV download button was on the right side to begin with but I found moving it across to the left and having it part of the list was more visually pleasing. My colour scheme is such that I needed navbar-light so the menu items were darker than the background colour. I stripped out all but the necessary parts for the desktop menu and gradually added in the collapsible section and the 'hamburger icon'from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/). By trying individual stylings, classes etc I gradually built an understanding of what each element did to the navigation bar. 

My mentor suggested I needed a 'call to action' feature on the landing page but after much thought I decided that would make that page messy. Instead I added a while [border](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp) to the CV Download menu option which draws the eye and encourages the user to download my CV. 
###### Final Test Results 
![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/ee7b78e153c3accb56c831fb2b8afbd895cb4522/assets/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_desktop.PNG) ![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/ee7b78e153c3accb56c831fb2b8afbd895cb4522/assets/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_mobile_hamburger.PNG) ![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/ee7b78e153c3accb56c831fb2b8afbd895cb4522/assets/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_mobile_dropdown.PNG)

I would prefer the white border around the CV download button on a mobile device to only outline the actual words. 

### Test the Footer
###### Development 
When I started out designing the footer bar, I wanted there to be a second place to download my CV but I found that made the footer look cluttered. Placing the social media icons in the centre allows for more space and cleaner styling. I used styling to increase the size of the icons. As part of the peer review Abi highlighted the footer seemed to be behaving strangely. I used Google to find out how I could force the footer to [stick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16679146/force-footer-on-bottom-on-pages-with-little-content) to the bottom of the page. Once that was working, I applied the same logic to force the header to stick to the top of the page which allowed for the longer pages to scroll behind both the header and the footer.
###### Final Test Results

### Navigation Testing
To ensure the navigation for both the navigation bar on the header and the footer social media icons I created then on the 'index.html' first, checked they worked and then copied it across to each of the other pages. I then selected each of the menu items and icons on each page to make sure they worked correctly.  The menu options all open the correct page with the exception of the 'CV Download' which opens my CV in a separate tab.  The social media links each open in a separate tab.

### Images
###### Development 
Initially I copied the overlay styling from [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history) but this did not give me the affect I was looking for. I wanted the images I was using to be more in the back ground so I used Google to investigate how to make the image fade into the background. I found information on opacity on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) which helped me to understand what I was doing and after playing with the fourth element of the rgba feature I got the result I was looking for. I am still unsure why I need to use '&nbsp;'(non-breaking space) for the opacity overlay but it works.

Originally, I wanted images on all my pages but found the 'My Story' page was too long for an image and as I develop more projects, I want to add more cards to the 'Projects' page which will also be too long.

### Contact Page
###### Development
Once the landing page was complete, I decided to work on the contact page. Although I had a rough design for the 'My Story' and 'Projects' pages I knew I was not completely happy with my ideas. Since my contact page body was idential in requirements to the one we had just done in the tutorials I decided to copy a section from the contact page on [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history). I soon learned, simply copying and pasting code into Gitpod does not necessarily work. There seem to be hidden characters that corrupt the code. I made some minor changes including the colour of the submit button to match my colour scheme and added in my email address to the submit button ready for when I have learned the JavaScript to make it send me an email. 

When I was testing the page, I noticed the email input accepted any text but forgot about it and only when I asked for a peer-review, and Scott mentioned it again did I investigate. Simply changing the input type from 'text' to 'email' fixed the problem.

### My Story Page
###### Development 
The 'My Story' page changed completely during the development of my site. I struggle with how to tell people who I am and what I do. As previously mentioned, I took inspiration from [Lucy Jones' website](https://lucyjpjones.github.io/LucyJones-resume/my-story.html). She has a small about me / contact section and two timelines. This gave me the two columns layout and the Work History from Code Institutes [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history) gave me the timeline layout. 

Getting the timelines to look balanced was tricky and involved many small adjustments and checking various sites for different stylings and the inspect facility in the browser was invaluable. 

After the peer review, I took Scott's advice and increased the font size on the timelines. He also suggested using the [tel](https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/att_input_type_tel.asp) tag allowing a mobile device to open the phone app with my mobile number ready to call - a very nice little feature I simply had not thought of. 

When I had made the header and footer stick to the top and bottom of the page, I had to adjust the padding at the top of each column and add in some extra styling in the @media section to remove the large gap between the timelines.

### Projects Page
###### Development 
I love the work page on [Haley Schafer's Portfolio](https://www.haleyschafer.com/) and used her design in the creation of my projects page. I used Google to help find more information about the [card](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_cards.asp). The cards are not big enough to have the description on them so I looked for a 'hover' effect and found [title](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_title.asp) attribute of the div element worked really well. 

When my younger daughter tested the site on her phone, she complained the cards did not show her anything if she tapped on them so I used Google again and found the [modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) classes as well as how to me a description to appear if that card was hovered over.

#### Code Verification
I used https://validator.w3.org/ to check my HTML5 and corrected the errors it highlighted.
I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to check my css. I had tried to use bottom with justify which didn't work. This helped to realise some of the un-used css I had created.
I used https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to add in any prefixes I had missed. 
I also copied the HTML into word to run a spell check over it and cleaned up my bad typing.
I used word to check my spelling.

##### Font style
I chose Chilanka because I like the clean lines and the almost handwriting effect but when I put might site out for appraisal I had a couple of previous colleagues say they didn't feel the font gave the right sort of image because it has a 'Comic Sans' look to it. They suggested I chose something like Helvetica but I am not keen on the shape of the 'a' so I changed the font to Mulish.
