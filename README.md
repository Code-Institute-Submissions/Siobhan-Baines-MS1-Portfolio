This project is to build a static front-end which demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies. 
The subject of this project is my personal portfolio including information about my past, present and future career. The front-end is designed to give any user an informative, interesting, user friendly and professional experience. There will be navigation to 3 pages, the first giving an outline of my previous career and skills, the second for details about some large past projects and placeholders for known future projects and the third giving a mechanism to contact me. There will also be links to my social media accounts and the ability to open my curriculum vitae on separate tab in pdf format.

## User Experience (UX)


### *User Stories*

1. **A new visitor to the site**

   As a new visitor to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about. I want to be able to easily navigate around the site to find all the information that is available including be able to download a copy of the curriculum vitae and the facility to check out their social media for any other useful information.

2. **A recruiter**

   As a recruiter I want this site to clearly showcase her career and educational history. I want to easily check her skill set comparing it against those required by my client. The ability to download her curriculum vitae will help to speed up the recruitment process and allow me to share her details with my client. I will need to have a quick and easy way to contact her if she meets the required criteria.
   
3. **An employer**

   As an employer I want her site to show me some of her personality as well as her technologically and soft skill sets so that I can evaluate her fit with my team and the job. I will want to contact her if she fits the profile I have in mind.

### *Strategy*
My design objective was to create a website showcasing a high-level of my technical skill set. I wanted the information to be easily accessible, clear and concise but at the same time giving the visitor everything they might want or need. 

### *Scope*
At the same time as providing a good outline of my skills and experience for a prospective employer I want to make the experience of using the site as enjoyable as possible and give them the facility to download my curriculum vitae and/or contract me directly as well as the ability to check out all my social media presence. I want some of my personality and style to come across in the site. 

### *Structure*
My landing page will be very simple with only my name and job title in the centre, a header navigation bar with the facility to download my CV and social media links on a static footer.

The 'My Story' page will give a brief overview of who I am and what I have done throughout my career in IT as well as the qualifications I have earned since leaving school.

The 'Projects' page will highlight some of the larger projects I have previously worked on my IT career and some place holders will be provided for the future mile stone projects with Code Institute which will have links to the projects source and deployed site.

### *Skeleton*
#### Wireframes
###### Initial Design
[Desktop](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/072cd4cb2541e2fbbe8c383273a9f79652423633/reference_documents/wireframes/initial_design/desktop_wire_frames_v1.0%20.pdf)

[Mobile](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/072cd4cb2541e2fbbe8c383273a9f79652423633/reference_documents/wireframes/initial_design/mobile_wire_frames_v1.0%20.pdf)

After working on various parts of the website I decided there were some things I did not like such as the icons for each menu option on the navigation bar, the positioning of the social media links, the download CV link and the layout of the My Story page (aka about).

###### Final Design
[Desktop](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/072cd4cb2541e2fbbe8c383273a9f79652423633/reference_documents/wireframes/final_design/desktop_wire_frames_v2.0.pdf)

[Mobile](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/072cd4cb2541e2fbbe8c383273a9f79652423633/reference_documents/wireframes/final_design/mobile_wire_frames_v2.0.pdf)

### *Surface*
The colour scheme was taken from the colours of [index_image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3ed4294aa8e1cb3cc202dc00b44f3063ae524b19/assets/images/index_image.png), 
[colour pallet](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/072cd4cb2541e2fbbe8c383273a9f79652423633/reference_documents/colour_pallet.pdf)
I believe the muted blues and browns give the site a more professional image which is easy on the eye. I chose the laptop and coffee image because the concept seems to fit well with my working personality. I always have a coffee by my side when I am coding.

## Features

### Existing Features

##### Header navigation bar
The navigation bar items are positioned to the left side of the screen and aligned in the centre of the bar. They give access to the My Story, Projects and Contact pages as well as allowing the site visitor to download my Curriculum Vitae. The 'CV Download' link has a white border designed to draw the attention of the visitor to download my CV to get more information about me.

When the visitor is using a small or mobile device the navigation menu shows as the 'hamburger' icon and when selected expands to a dropdown menu. 

##### Footer
The final design of the footer is to have links to all my social media presence only. This feature will allow the visitor to gain more information about my technical abilities, the projects I have developed or worked on and an insight into who me as a person. 

##### Images
The images give the site a warm comfortable and professional feel.

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/contact_image.png)

##### Home Page
I wanted to keep the landing page eye catching but very simple which is why it only has my name and a future job title. 

##### My Story Page
Initially I thought I just wanted two or three sentences about me, what I have done and what I want to do but nothing I thought of seem appropriate or to add value. While looking on LinkedIn at some of my contact's pages, I noticed Lucy Jones had a link to her MS1 project which is her portfolio. Her website gave me the inspiration I need to create my own 'My Story' page. Her design showed me how I could have a small section about me and how to contact me, as well have two separate timelines, one for my work experience and one for qualifications.

##### Projects Page
In my orginial design I was only going to have the projects I will be completing through the course but this didn't feel right as I came to work on the page. I have over 30 years in Information Technology and have worked on many projects at various levels. It is appropriate this page included the at least the three most recent big projects I have been involved in as well as the milestone projects from the Diploma in Software Development course I am currently studying. As my career moves forward, I can expand this area to accommodate more projects. 

##### Contact Page
My contact page is very simple so I decided to use a background image to add interest. There are input fields for a name, email address and a decription of what the contact is in relation to.

### Features Left to Implement

Link to Milestone Project 2 - The interactive front-end project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

Link to Milestone Project 3  - The data centric project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

Link to Milestone Project 4 - The final project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

## Technologies Used
CSS3, HMTL5, Bootstrap Framework, Google, Fontawesome

## Testing
The testing process was on-going through-out the whole of the website development. I would change a colour and test it to see how it worked with my design. Adjusting the position of elements would involve multiple tests until it was in just the right place. I added padding and removed padding, added margins and removed margins just to see what result I would get. When the site was as good as I thought I could make it, I asked my family and friends to review it and later I asked for a peer-review on Slack.

### Test the Navigation Bar between Desktop and Mobile
Test the navigation bar collapses to give the 'hamburger' icon when the device is smaller than medium.
###### Development 
Initially I started out copying the source from [Whiskey Drop](https://siobhanbaines.github.io/BootstrapWhiskey/) but soon found there were items I did not understand so went back to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) and googled other navigation bars. My CV download button was on the right side to begin with but I found moving it across to the left and having it part of the list was more visually pleasing. My colour scheme is such that I needed navbar-light so the menu items were darker than the background colour. I stripped out all but the necessary parts for the desktop menu and gradually added in the collapsible section and the 'hamburger icon'from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bars?style=solid). By trying individual stylings, classes etc I gradually built an understanding of what each element did to the navigation bar. 

My mentor suggested I needed a 'call to action' feature on the landing page but after much thought I decided that would make that page messy. Instead I added a while [border](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp) to the CV Download menu option which draws the eye and encourages the user to download my CV. 
###### Final Test Results 
![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_desktop.png) 
![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_mobile_hamburger.png) ![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/header_mobile_dropdown.png)

I would prefer the white border around the CV download button on a mobile device to only outline the actual words. 

### Test the Footer
###### Development 
When I started out designing the footer bar, I wanted there to be a second place to download my CV but I found that made the footer look cluttered. Placing the social media icons in the centre allows for more space and cleaner styling. I used styling to increase the size of the icons. As part of the peer review Abi highlighted the footer seemed to be behaving strangely. I used Google to find out how I could force the footer to [stick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16679146/force-footer-on-bottom-on-pages-with-little-content) to the bottom of the page. Once that was working, I applied the same logic to force the header to stick to the top of the page which allowed for the longer pages to scroll behind both the header and the footer.
###### Final Test Results
![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/images_readme/test-results-images/footer.png)

### Navigation Testing
To ensure the navigation for both the navigation bar on the header and the footer social media icons I created then on the 'index.html' first, checked they worked and then copied it across to each of the other pages. I then selected each of the menu items and icons on each page to make sure they worked correctly.  The menu options all open the correct page with the exception of the 'CV Download' which opens my CV in a separate tab.  The social media links each open in a separate tab.

### Images
###### Development 
Initially I copied the overlay styling from [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history) but this did not give me the affect I was looking for. I wanted the images I was using to be more in the back ground so I used Google to investigate how to make the image fade into the background. I found information on opacity on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) which helped me to understand what I was doing and after playing with the fourth element of the rgba feature I got the result I was looking for. I am still unsure why I need to use '&nbsp;'(non-breaking space) for the opacity overlay but it works.

Originally, I wanted images on all my pages but found the 'My Story' page was too long for an image and as I develop more projects, I want to add more cards to the 'Projects' page which will also be too long.

### Contact Page
###### Development
Once the landing page was complete, I decided to work on the contact page. Although I had a rough design for the 'My Story' and 'Projects' pages I knew I was not completely happy with my ideas. Since my contact page body was idential in requirements to the one we had just done in the tutorials I decided to copy a section from the contact page on [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history). I soon learned, simply copying and pasting code into Gitpod does not necessarily work. There seem to be hidden characters that corrupt the code. I made some minor changes including the colour of the submit button to match my colour scheme and added in my email address to the submit button ready for when I have learned the JavaScript to make it send me an email. 

When I was testing the page, I noticed the email input accepted any text but forgot about it and only when I asked for a peer-review, and Scott mentioned it again did I investigate. Simply changing the input type from 'text' to 'email' fixed the problem.

### My Story Page
###### Development 
The 'My Story' page changed completely during the development of my site. I struggle with how to tell people who I am and what I do. As previously mentioned, I took inspiration from [Lucy Jones' website](https://lucyjpjones.github.io/LucyJones-resume/my-story.html). She has a small about me / contact section and two timelines. This gave me the two columns layout and the Work History from Code Institutes [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history) gave me the timeline layout. 

Getting the timelines to look balanced was tricky and involved many small adjustments and checking various sites for different stylings and the inspect facility in the browser was invaluable. 

After the peer review, I took Scott's advice and increased the font size on the timelines. He also suggested using the [tel](https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/att_input_type_tel.asp) tag allowing a mobile device to open the phone app with my mobile number ready to call - a very nice little feature I simply had not thought of. 

When I had made the header and footer stick to the top and bottom of the page, I had to adjust the padding at the top of each column and add in some extra styling in the @media section to remove the large gap between the timelines.

### Projects Page
###### Development 
I love the work page on [Haley Schafer's Portfolio](https://www.haleyschafer.com/) and used her design in the creation of my projects page. I used Google to help find more information about the [card](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_cards.asp). The cards are not big enough to have the description on them so I looked for a 'hover' effect and found [title](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_title.asp) attribute of the div element worked really well. 

When my younger daughter tested the site on her phone, she complained the cards did not show her anything if she tapped on them so I used Google again and found the [modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) classes as well as how to me a description to appear if that card was hovered over.

### Performance Testing using Lighthouse

#### Home page 	index.html
The first test I performed for the website was for the desktop version and gave these results.

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/index_tests/index-desktop-before.png)

I then run the test for the mobile version and these were the results

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/index_tests/index-mobile-before.png)

[Report for Home-page Mobile before](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/index_tests/index-mobile-before.pdf)

On the desktop Lighthouse report the Accessibility dashboard was not green, I investigated the 3 issues.

1. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio
    a.nav.link
a.nav.link is the navigation menu options on the header. I tried changing the colour of the font but it did not resolve the issue. 
When I used standard devtools and looked at the css the navigation menu options were looking at I found they were picking up the bootstrap navbar classes below 
.navbar-light .navbar-nav .nav-link {
color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
}

I added the same classes into the website’s css.style file which fixed the issue.
.navbar-light .navbar-nav .nav-link{
    color: #444c5d;
}
2. Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order.
    h3.jobtitle
    I wanted the jobtitle to be the size of the standard h3 so I left this alone
3. Links do not have a discernible name
    a 
    These are for the icons. I don’t want text next to the icons.
I re-ran the Lighthouse in desktop mode and the test came back all green.

[Report for Home-page Desktop After](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/index_tests/index-desktop-after.pdf)

Out of curiosity I wanted to see if anything had changed on the mobile before I investigated the errors in the original Lighthouse test so I reran the diagnostic test and these were the results. My assumption is before I had added in the above styling into the website’s style sheet, the website wanted to use some JavaScript provided by Bootstrap and was not needed when the css was corrected.

#### My Story page 	about.html
I repeated the diagnostic tests using Lighthouse on the My Story page for desktop and these are the results.

Since all the results were green no further action is necessary.

#### Projects page 	projects.html

On the desktop Lighthouse report the Accessibility dashboard was not green, I investigated the 3 issues.

1.	Buttons do not have an accessible name
        button.card-text
        The error suggests a button element needs a name attribute. Google brought up w3schools.com which explained more about the button element. 
        a.	I gave each card a name but it didn’t change anything.
        b.	Read the full details on Lighthouse and change name=”description” to aria-label="description". This resolved the issue.
2.	Links do not have a discernible name 
        a
        These are for the icons. I don’t want text next to the icons.
3.	Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio 
        p.card-title
        As with the Home page this attribute is picking the bootstrap attribute
        Changing the colour of the font from #444c5d to #2e1f0e resolved the issue.

I re-ran the desktop version of the test and these were the results.

#### Contact page 	contact.html
I repeated the diagnostic tests using Lighthouse on the Contact page for desktop and these are the results.

On the desktop Lighthouse report the Accessibility dashboard was not green, I investigated the 4 issues.

1.	The page does not contain a heading, skip link or landmark region
        Html
        Lighthouse suggests adding a ‘skip-link’ to skip to the main content. I added <a href="#contact-form">Skip to form</a> just under <body> and <form><a name="contact-form" id="contact-form"></a> at the top of the form. Then I re-ran Lighthouse and the accessibility count had increased from 75 to 79.
        If I change the button colour to black I can remove the issue
2.	Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ration
        button.btn.btn-secondary
        As with the other colour contrast issues – add .btn-secondary class to the websites css file
        The original background colour for the button was #8c7444 and I have changed it to #2c3035. From an aesthetic perspective I believe #8c7444 was more pleasing to the eye.
3.	Form elements do not have associated labels
        input#fullname.form-control
        input#emailaddress.form-control
        textarea#contact-reason.form-control

Adding <label> increased the accessibility to 99 which I have left in for this project but in my opinion the form looked cleaner when <placeholder> was used instead of <label>

4.	Links do not have a discernible name
        a
        These are for the icons. I don’t want text next to the icons.

I re-ran the mobile version of the test to check the fixes already applied resolved the issues raise on the previous mobile test.

There are 2 red triangles under the performance.
1.	Eliminate render-blocking resources
        This relates to unused CSS and JavaScript. I can only review the CSS because I do have not yet learned JavaScript. When I checked the below screen, I could only review https://8000-d272d922-26dd-4345-9.../style.css because the others did not belong to me and although were not used in the load of the page they were used by features on the page. 
        
![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/bcbadf02d1598869e8491236d1e206969babc54a/reference_documents/lighthouse_testing/contact_tests/contact-mobile-coverage.png)

        The only change I could make is to remove the below because it is not used on any of the pages
        .jumbotron { 
            background: transparent;
        }
3.	Ensure text remains visible during webfont load
        I tried changing the googlefonts link to be preload but it failed because I needed to add the as element which then caused the load to fail because it didn’t like the href link. I rechecked the link was correct. Lighthouse also suggested adding @font-face but this made no difference. 
        <link rel="preload" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mulish:wght@300;400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

        The performance count has increased from 84 to 88 and I do not believe there is anything else I can change at this time. Only 2 points for being green.

#### Code Verification
#### validator.w3
I used https://validator.w3.org/ to check my HTML5 and corrected the errors it highlighted.

###### about.html
This page came back clean when run through the validator
###### contact.html
The validator told me the "name" attribute on the a element was obsolete which I had added because Lighthouse told me I needed it. The validator also told me I needed an h2...h6 element.
I removed the "name" attribute and added an h2 element with a class .form-header which I gave the CCS of display:none; because I did not want it to display. I then saved the changes and refreshed Lighthouse.

I removed the <a> attribute, saved the changes and refreshed Lighthouse.

I then  refreshed Lighthouse and generated the report for mobile.

#### jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator
I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to check my css. I had tried to use bottom with justify which didn't work. This helped to realise some of the un-used css I had created.
###### style.css
The validator highlighted the errors below

![image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/fa021d3098237bdbb65b584e483cce2ce87b029b/reference_documents/code_validation/jigsaw_css_validation.png)

260	button.card-text	Value Error : padding , is an incorrect operator : 1px,0

I removed the comma from "    padding: 1px, 0;" - typing error
I then saved the change and refreshed the browser to make sure the projects page did not change.

269	.card-text	Value Error : padding -5px negative values are not allowed : 30px 10px -5px 10px
I changed the -5px to 0px which caused the icons in the cards to move to the bottom of the card too far.
I the used DevTools to review what was happening with the "card-text" class and decided to remove the padding. This moved the icons away from the very bottom of the card. I assume this line of styling had been ignored because it was incorrect.

331	.btn-secondary	Value Error : font-style bold is not a font-style value : bold
I thought I should have used "font-weight" but used google to check. I then changed it to "font-weight", saved and refreshed the browser. Now the wording is bold and I want to check if I change the button colour back to is original colour of #8c7444 and run through Lighthouse.
These are the results for desktop.

#### autoprefixer.github
I used https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to add in any prefixes I had missed. 

#### Word
I also copied the HTML and MD files into word to run a spell check over it and cleaned up my bad typing.
I used word to check my spelling.

##### Font style
I chose Chilanka because I like the clean lines and the almost handwriting effect but when I put might site out for appraisal I had a couple of previous colleagues say they didn't feel the font gave the right sort of image because it has a 'Comic Sans' look to it. They suggested I chose something like Helvetica but I am not keen on the shape of the 'a' so I changed the font to Mulish.

### Lessons learned
1. When commencing on a Milestone Project I need to make sure I have read and watched ALL the instructions and not just the Assessment Handbook. That way I will not lose points for 
    a. not creating the Tablet wireframes
        Creating the wireframes for at least desktop, tablet and mobile up front shows I have an idea and understanding of how the website will change as the hardware it is running on changes.
    b. not showing ALL my test evidence for each piece of HTML and CSS I changed and worked on
        Working on these milestone projects is not quite the same as working on a program in the industry. This is a university level qualification and I need to show how I achieved the results I did and why I chose to do some of the things I did not just code, test and fix as I would in the real world until I had a working site ready to be unit tested before user acceptance testing.
    c. use OneNote at least to document as I go so that I do not lose any important information
        This will help me keep track of all the webpages I visited even if I do not use anything from them in the final product. It will help with the on-going documentation
2. Allow more time for the documentation so I do not miss any opportunities.
