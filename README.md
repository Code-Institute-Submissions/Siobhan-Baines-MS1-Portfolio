This project is to build a static front-end which demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies. The subject of this project is my personal portfolio including information about my past, present and future career. The front-end is designed to give any user an informative, interesting, user friendly and professional experience. There will be navigation to 2/3 pages, links to my social media accounts, information about past projects and place holders for future projects, the ability to open my curriculum vitae on a separate tab in pdf format and the facility to contact me directly.

## User Experience (UX)


### *User Stories*

1. **A new visitor to the site**

   As a new visitor to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about, I want to be able to easily navigate around the site to find all it's content and I may want to be to check out their social media for any other useful information.

2. **A recruiter**

   As a recruiter I want this site to clearly showcase her ability and the technologies she is adept in using so that I can compare her skill set to those of my client.

3. **An employer**

   As an employer I want her site to show me some of her personality as well as her technologically skill set so that I can evaluate her fit with my team.

### *Strategy*
My design objective was to create a website showcasing a highlevel of my technical skill set. I wanted the information to be easily accessible, clear and concise but at the same time giving the visitor everything they might want or need.

### *Scope*
At the same time as providing a good outline of my skills and experience for a prospective employer I wanted to make the experience of using the site as enjoyable as possible and give them the facility to download my curriculum vitae and/or contract me directly as well as the ability to check out all my social media presence. 

### *Structure*
My landing page will be very simple with only my name and job title in the centre, the header navigation and the footer links.

The 'My Story' page will give a brief overview of who I am and what I have done throughout my career in IT as well as the qualifications I have earned since leaving school.

The 'Projects' page will highlight some of the larger projects I have previously worked on my IT career and some place holders for the future mile stone projects with Code Institute which will eventually have links to the projects source and deployed site.

There will be a contact page to allow prospective employers to contact me via email.

Finally, there will be links to my social media accounts including LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook,Twitter and Instagram as well as providing the ability to download my CV. Where there are active links, they will open in a separate tab. 

### *Skeleton*
#### Wireframes
[Initial Design](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/345ae61c1f846b4b615f850372655e3cbb849780/assets/reference_documents/wireframes/Initial_Design)

After working on various parts of the website I decided there were some things I did not like such as the icons for each menu option on the navigation bar, the positioning of the social media links, the download CV link and the layout of the My Story page (aka about).

[Final Design](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/345ae61c1f846b4b615f850372655e3cbb849780/assets/reference_documents/wireframes/Final_Design)

### *Surface*
The colour scheme was taken from the colours of [index_image](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3d543c973fc56c4d8cb2472d9554478aa2aebc81/assets/images/index_image.png) 
[colour pallet](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3d543c973fc56c4d8cb2472d9554478aa2aebc81/assets/reference_documents/colour_pallet.pdf)
I believe the muted blues and browns give the site a more professional image which is easy on the eye. I chose the laptop and coffee image because the concept seems to fit well with my working personality. I always have a coffee by my side when I am coding which has usually gone cold.

## Features

### Existing Features

##### Header navigation bar

Initially I based my navigation bar on the one in the Whiskey Drop tutorial but I struggled to get it working. By using google I came across this bootstrap grid [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPmwdshCMw). After watching I was able to get the navigation bar to not only work but to look how I wanted it to on the screen.

##### Image

I wanted the images I was using to be more in the back ground and after using Google I found this information on opacity - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp which gave the the information I needed to achieve the result I was looking for.

##### Time line for Qualifications and Experience

The Work History from Code Institutes [resume-miniproject-bootstrap4](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/16-adding-work-history) to give me the basic outline.

### Features Left to Implement

Link to Milestone Project 2 - The interactive front-end project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.
Link to Milestone Project 3  - The data centric project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

Link to Milestone Project 4 - The final project will be added later and the links to the site and github will be activated. I have left placeholders in the code for the links.

## Technologies Used
CSS3
HMTL5
Bootstrap Framework

## Testing

### On All pages 

#### Test Scenario 1

Test the navigation bar collapses to give the 'hamburger' icon when the device is smaller than medium.

#### Test Scenario 2
Select the ‘My Story’ page link on the navigation bar on each page to ensure it takes the user to the ‘My Story’ page and does not error

#### Test Scenario 3
Select the ‘Projects’ page link on the navigation bar on each page to ensure it takes the user to the ‘Projects’ page and does not error

#### Test Scenario 4
Select the ‘Contact’ page link on the navigation bar on each page to ensure it takes the user to the ‘Contact’ page and does not error

#### Test Scenario 5

Select ‘Download CV' link on the navigation bar on each page to ensure it opens my Curriculum Vitae on a separate tab in pdf format

#### Test Scenario 6

Check each of the social media links take the user to the correct social media page.
GitHub
LinkedIn
Facebook
Instagram
Twitter

### My Story Page

#### Test Scenario 7

Click on my email address on 'My Story' page to check it creates an email with my email address and the recipients' address

### Projects Page

#### Test Scenario 8

Test each future project has a link that currently does not lead anywhere.

### Contact Page

#### Test Scenario 8

Test the Name and Email fields are filled in with the correct type of information (the email address field is set up for an email) on the contact page before the form will submit.

#### Test Scenario 9
Does the submit button on the contact page email the details?

### Transition from Desktop to Mobile

#### Test Scenario 10
Do the pages flow smoothly on a mobile device?

Does the content look clean and readable, and does it fit well in the mobile device screen?

Does the scroll work properly?

[Test Evidence](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/Siobhan-Baines-MS1-Portfolio/blob/3173bb0888cfd407e5ef37cbd2af27a6560ac6e5/assets/reference_documents/MS1_Test_Evidence.pdf)

Once I had completed my unit testing, I sent the link to family and friend asking them to be critical. Perhaps family and friends are too kind.

The final test is to ask for a peer review.

#### Other Testing
I used https://validator.w3.org/ to check my HTML5. 
#### Projects Page 
Validator.w3 shows that h3, h5 and p tags are not valid children of button. I wanted the whole card to act like a button so that it would make the description pop-up in a separate window for review. I wanted to keep the format of the card as it was before. When the pop-up window is closed it leaves a border of the button showing which card was reviewed. I think this is useful especially when viewed on a mobile device. As my skills develop I will probably find a cleaner way of achieving the same result and will update it at that point.
 
I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to check my css. 
I used https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to add in any prefixes I had missed. 
I also copied the HTML into word to run a spell check over it and cleaned up my bad typing.
